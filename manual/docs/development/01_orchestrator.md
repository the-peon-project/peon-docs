# Orchestrator

The Orc (orchestrator) module is the heart of the project.

It is what manages the process of game server deployment for users.

---

## Design Objectives

- Extremely lightweight.
- [REST API managed](../guides/02_rest_api.md)
- Deploy/control game containers.
- Abstracted from the game server/container platform to allow stack evolution.
