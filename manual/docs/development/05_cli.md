# CLI

A handy CLI to manage PEON services remotely (as well as to provide extended access/control)

## Installation

If not installed via installation script, the `peon-cli` can be installed manually.

1. Download & copy the `peon-cli` folder into your preferred path.
2. Create a folder/file `./config/peon_dir` in the root path of the `peon-cli` scripts folder.
3. Input the full path of the `peon` installation directory (e.g. `/home/myuser/peon`) into the `peon_dir` file in the `peon-cli` scripts folder.
4. Add your `peon-cli` script folder to your path (if you wish)

## Usage

### Interactive mode

The peon cli offers an interactive mode for administration services
Just run `./peon`

### Non-Interactive mode

Some standard peon-cli tools can be executed programmatically using flags.
Just run `./peon [flags]`
