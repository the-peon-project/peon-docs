## Before you start

### World Saves

Your world saves will be stored in the path `./user` if you use the provided `docker-compose.yml`.
This will allow you to download/backup/move files around at your leisure.

## Manually Configuring Settings

You can go to the official docs to see what you can change. Just replace the config files with what you want and restart the server.

All of these files can be found and edited in the server's local storage path.
