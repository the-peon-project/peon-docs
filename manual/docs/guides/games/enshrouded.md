## Before you start

### World Saves

Your world saves will be stored in the path `./user` if you use the provided `docker-compose.yml`.
You can find the Server Config in the Config subfolder and your saved game in the SaveGames subfolder.
This will allow you to download/backup/move files around at your leisure.

All of these files can be found and edited in the server's local storage path.

`./peon/servers/[game_uid]/[server_name]/`
