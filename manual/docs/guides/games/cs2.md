## Before you start

### Game Server Login Token

If you wish to run this server outside of your private network (required by Steam for any servers running outside of your home LAN), you will need to get a game server login token.

## Manually Configuring Settings

You can go to the official docs to see what you can change. Just replace the config files with what you want and restart the server.

All of these files can be found and edited in the server's local storage path.
